Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma Contest

Sample code for Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma Contest.
Actual contest parameters will vary, but this will help you test a bunch of ideas against a sort-of-representative pool
of agents (at least in the early- to mid-game).

Edit contest.CKTournament locally to modify initial pool settings and to add/remove agents from the pool.
Create as many agents as you want and see how they play together.
